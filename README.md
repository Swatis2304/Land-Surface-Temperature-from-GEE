This repository stores the code to fetch Max, Min, Median LST Rasters of Landsat 8 from Google Earth Engine and then calculates NDVI and Emissivity using those. The exported outputs are stores as GeoTif files. 

Shareable GEE code is stored here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Farswatisharma2304%2FLST_LANDSAT_NYC%3AMEAN%20MAX%20MEDIAN%20LST%20NYC
